> # Daily_Coding_Challenge

Welcome to my Daily Coding Challenge repository!

**Purpose**
This repository is dedicated to my commitment to improving my coding skills by tackling a new coding challenge every day. The goal is to solve problems, write clean code, and continuously learn and grow as a developer.

**Structure**
Each day's challenge will be stored in a separate folder named after the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Inside each folder, you will find the following:

README.md: A description of the day's challenge, including problem statement, approach, and key learnings.

solution.[ext]: The solution to the challenge, written in the relevant programming language.

tests.[ext]: Test cases used to verify the solution (if applicable).

How to Use
Feel free to browse through the daily challenges and explore the solutions. You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
git clone : https://github.com/Manju-IT/Daily_Coding_Challenge.git

Contributions
I welcome contributions! If you have a coding challenge you'd like to see or improvements to existing solutions, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback and collaboration are highly appreciated.
